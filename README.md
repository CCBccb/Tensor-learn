# DNTFNet
It is an efficient solver for high-order tensor decomposition.
The above code is used to perform high-order tensor decomposition on high-dimensional data and optimize the filter with an efficient solver. 
The code provides a simple MATLAB runtime script Demo. 
The operation process is as follows: 
First, add the tensor operation function. Specifically, set the path, add the @ktensor, @sptenmat, @sptensor, @tenmat, @tensor, met folder 
and its subfolders to the MATLAB path, and save. 
Secondly, click on "Demo" and run it.
